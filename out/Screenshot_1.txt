Tesseract at UB Mannheim

The Mannheim University Library (UB Mannheim) uses Tesseract to perform text recognition (OCR = optical character
recognition) for historical German newspapers (Allgemeine Preubische Staatszeitung, Deutscher Reichsanzeiger). The latest
results with text from more than 700000 pages are available online.

Tesseract installer for Windows

Normally we run Tesseract on Debian GNU Linux, but there was also the need for a Windows version. That's why we have built
a Tesseract installer for Windows.

WARNING: Tesseract should be either installed in the directory which is suggested during the installation or in a new
directory. The uninstaller removes the whole installation directory. !f you installed Tesseract in an existing directory, that
directory will be removed with all its subdirectories and files.

The latest installers can be downloaded here:

* tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-5.5.0.20241111.exe (64 bit)

There are also older versions for 32 and 64 bit Windows available.
In addition, we also provide documentation which was generated by Doxygen.

Tesseract models for historic prints

Historic books printed in Fraktur script are supported by the standard models deu latf (formerly frk) and seripi/Fraktur. In

addition we trained our own models on a wide range of historic books. They are available online. In many cases the results
from those models (Fraktur 5000000, frak2021, german print) are better than those from the standard models.
